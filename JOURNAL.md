# Total hours : 3

# 13/12/2025 | Finaly start this project !!! (Creating the necessary items)
Hi, I've finally managed to free up some time to set up this project. The goal: to create this small, intelligent robot named Luxi (referring to its glowing eyes).

This project will progress at an approximate rate of about 4 hours per week during term time and 7 hours per week during holidays (note that this may change depending on the workload assigned by my professors).

For these first three hours, I have:

- Researched the implementation of this project (LLM, Python, and hardware)
- Created Luxi's GitHub page
- Created and completed the Bill of Materials (BOM)
- Created a preview **using Artificial Intelligence** because I'm terrible at drawing, to get an overall idea of ​​this little robot, which is shown here:   <img width="512" height="678" alt="Prévisualisation" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/554d73bf-16ae-4d3b-a40b-65c06a3f9d1e" />
